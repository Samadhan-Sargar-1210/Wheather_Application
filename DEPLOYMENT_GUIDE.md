## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Both platforms need this environment variable:

| Variable Name | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key | `abc123def456...` |

### How to Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. **Go to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)**
2. **Sign up for a free account**
3. **Go to "My API Keys"**
4. **Copy your API key**
5. **Add it to your deployment platform's environment variables**

## ðŸ“± Build Configuration

### Build Commands

Both platforms use these settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: `18` (recommended)

### Build Process

Your Vite configuration already includes:
- Code splitting for better performance
- Security headers
- Production optimizations
- Console log removal in production

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Deployment

Both platforms offer automatic deployments:

### Netlify
- Automatically deploys when you push to your main branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Branch deployments for different environments

### Vercel
- Automatic deployments on every push
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Branch deployments with custom domains

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist

1. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Check for errors** in the build process

3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly

4. **Test the deployed site** for:
   - Weather search functionality
   - Location-based weather
   - Theme switching
   - Language switching
   - Voice assistant
   - Responsive design

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution**: Check environment variables are set correctly

#### Issue: Build failing
**Solution**: 
1. Check Node.js version compatibility
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Check for syntax errors in your code

#### Issue: 404 errors on refresh
**Solution**: Both platforms handle this automatically with their configuration
